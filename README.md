Credit Scoring Model – Internship Project

This project builds a Decision Tree–based Credit Scoring Model to classify whether a customer has Good Credit or Bad Credit.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and model export.

Project Workflow:

Loaded a sample dataset generated inside the notebook
Preprocessed and cleaned the data
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluated using:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Visualized the decision tree
Exported model as credit_model.pkl
Generated a text-based project report

Model Used:

Decision Tree Classifier (Gini Index)
Implemented using scikit-learn

 Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Tree Visualization
All outputs are visible inside the Jupyter Notebook and saved in report.txt.

Saved Model:

The trained model is exported to:
models/credit_model.pkl
This file can be loaded later for deployment.

Tools & Libraries:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
